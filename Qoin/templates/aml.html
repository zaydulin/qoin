                  <span class="service-rules"
                    >1. In accordance with international law, the Service
                    adheres to a number of rules and implements procedures aimed
                    at preventing the use of the Service for money laundering
                    and other illegal activities.<br /><br />2. To prevent
                    illegal transactions, the Service establishes certain
                    requirements for all Requests created by the User:</span
                  ><span class="prohibited-transfers"
                    >Transfers to third parties are strictly prohibited;<br />All
                    contact information entered by the User in the Request, as
                    well as other personal data transmitted by the User to the
                    Service, must be current and completely accurate;<br />It is
                    strictly prohibited for the User to create Requests using
                    anonymous proxy servers or any other anonymous internet
                    connections.</span
                  >
                </div>
                <div class="empty-6">
                  <span class="kyc-policy"
                    >3. The Service reserves the right to request a photo or
                    video of the User with an identification document as part of
                    the KYC (Know Your Customer) policy. The Client's
                    identification information will be collected, stored,
                    transferred, and protected strictly in accordance with the
                    Company's Personal Data Processing Policy.<br /><br />4. The
                    User will be denied an exchange if the Service is not
                    satisfied with the information provided, or if there are
                    doubts as to the User's identity.<br /><br />5. The Service
                    reserves the right to suspend all current User requests
                    until the User receives copies of their identity documents
                    and other information necessary to verify the transaction in
                    the following cases:</span
                  ><span class="violation-requirements"
                    >If a violation of any of the requirements set out in
                    Section 2 of this Agreement is detected;<br />If the User's
                    request is suspended by the fraud prevention system;<br />If
                    the Service has reasonable grounds to suspect that the User
                    is attempting to use the Service for the purpose of
                    conducting illegal transactions;<br />If high-risk
                    transactions involving the User's details are detected.<br />In
                    turn, the User undertakes to provide the requested document
                    within 7 business days of receiving the request for its
                    provision, or request cancellation of the request.</span
                  >
                </div>
                <div class="empty-7">
                  <span class="high-risk-transactions"
                    >6. To identify high-risk transactions and addresses, the
                    Service uses an internal verification and analysis system.
                    The Service reserves the right not to disclose information
                    about the methods and results of verifying the User's
                    transactions.<br /><br />7. If high-risk transactions
                    involving the User's details are detected, the Service
                    reserves the right to cancel the request and return the
                    funds or digital currencies deposited by the User. Refunds
                    are made only to the details from which the transfer was
                    made. When making a refund, all commission costs for the
                    transfer of funds or digital currencies are covered by the
                    User from the funds received. The Service is not responsible
                    for any possible delays in refunds that are not the
                    Service's fault.<br /><br />8. If the User refuses to
                    provide the requested documents, the Service reserves the
                    right to refuse further service to the User.<br /><br />9.
                    The Service reserves the right to refuse further service to
                    the User and transfer all User data held by the Service, as
                    well as all available information about the User's
                    transactions, to law enforcement agencies in the following
                    cases:</span
                  ><span class="money-laundering-identification"
                    >Identification of transactions aimed at money laundering,
                    financing terrorist organizations, fraud of any kind, or
                    transactions aimed at conducting any other illegal or
                    improper operations;<br />If the Service has reasonable
                    grounds to suspect that the identification document provided
                    by the User is counterfeit or invalid;<br />Receipt of
                    information from authorized bodies regarding the User's
                    illegal possession of funds or digital currencies, or other
                    information that makes it impossible for the Service to
                    provide services to the User;<br />Identification of any
                    actions or attempted actions by the User aimed at exerting
                    any negative impact on the Service's hardware and
                    software;<br />Detection of any actions or attempted actions
                    by the User aimed at stealing databases or other tangible or
                    intangible assets of the Service;<br />Detection of any
                    actions or attempted actions by the User that could cause
                    any physical, tangible, or intangible damage to the
                    Service;<br />If funds are received from a card different
                    from the one verified, the Service will suspend the
                    exchange. Funds for this request will be returned to the
                    sender within 24 hours of the request and subject to
                    mandatory verification of the card from which the funds were
                    received. When making a refund, all commission costs for the
                    transfer of funds or digital currencies will be covered from
                    the received funds at the User's expense.</span

                    other information confirming payment for the request.<br /><br />11.
